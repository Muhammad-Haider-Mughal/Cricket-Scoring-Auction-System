🏏 Cricket Scoring & Auction System 🖥️
A desktop-based Cricket Scoring Application and Player Auction System developed in C++ using the Qt Framework during our 2nd semester at FAST-NUCES as part of the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) course.

🔮 Project Overview

The Cricket Scoring & Auction System is a dual-feature application that combines real-time match scoring with a player auction management system.
The scoring module allows users to record runs, wickets, overs, and player performances dynamically, while the auction system enables team owners to bid, buy, and manage players within a set budget.

This project represents our introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and GUI-based development using Qt in C++, reflecting our early grasp of structured programming, class design, and logical flow control.
